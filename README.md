# GitChain: an eco-organic git based blockchain

Blockchains are overly complex...
Git already has the basic functionality make a secure ledger
We want to add a "consensus" extension to git so
we can fetch,push and merge from and to public keys (via [pull-requests][1] exchange and approval)

making Git a fullfledge blockchain

We will demonstrate that git can be used to mint a native token: "gitcoin"
for utilities,value and governance for every git repository turn into DAOs
with this extension.
